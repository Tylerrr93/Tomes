# Tomes: A Literary Expansion for Vintage Story
## Overview
Tomes is a comprehensive mod for the survival sandbox game Vintage Story, designed to enrich the in-game experience by introducing a robust system for literacy, documentation, and knowledge preservation. This mod transforms how players interact with written information, moving beyond simple notes to offer detailed book creation, historical record-keeping, and the ultimate tool for mass production: the Gutenberg Printing Press.

This project showcases my capabilities in both game development/modding (C# programming) and graphic design (3D modeling & texturing), demonstrating a full-stack approach to creating immersive and functional in-game content.

# Features
Tomes introduces several key elements that integrate seamlessly into the Vintage Story world:

## Clay Tablets:

### Functionality: Early-game writable surfaces for simple notes, recipes, or short messages.

### Design Highlight: Custom textures and item behaviors that fit the game's prehistoric/early-industrial aesthetic. This involved graphic design for the tablet's visual appearance and C# coding for its interactive writing mechanics.

## Detailed Book System:

### Functionality: Craftable books with multiple pages, allowing for extensive writing, storytelling, and record-keeping. Players can write and read complex narratives.

### Design Highlight: Custom book models and textures that evolve with different material tiers. The implementation required intricate C# programming for page management, text rendering, saving/loading content, and a user-friendly in-game writing interface.

## Gutenberg Printing Press:

### Functionality: The pinnacle of the mod, this multi-block structure allows players to duplicate written books efficiently. It requires ink, paper, and a master book to operate, simulating a realistic printing process.

### Design Highlight: This feature is a significant demonstration of 3D modeling and texturing skills. I designed and created the detailed model for the printing press, ensuring it fits Vintage Story's art style while being visually distinct and mechanically intuitive. The C# codebase manages the complex crafting recipes, multi-block structure placement, inventory management, and the intricate logic behind the printing process itself.

## Skills Demonstrated
This project highlights a diverse skill set essential for game development and creative technical roles:

### 1. Programming & Game Logic (C#)
Mod Development: Experience with the Vintage Story API, understanding game mechanics, and extending core functionalities.

Object-Oriented Design: Structuring complex systems (books, printing press) using classes, interfaces, and inheritance for maintainability and scalability.

User Interface (UI) Development: Implementing interactive in-game UIs for writing in books and operating the printing press.

Data Persistence: Handling the saving and loading of custom data (book content) within the game world.

Event Handling: Responding to player interactions, block placements, and item usage.

Performance Optimization: Writing efficient code to ensure smooth gameplay.

### 2. Graphic Design & 3D Asset Creation
3D Modeling: Creating custom 3D models for in-game objects, most notably the intricate Gutenberg Printing Press. This includes understanding poly counts, optimization for game engines, and visual fidelity.

Texturing: Developing custom textures for all new items and blocks (clay tablets, various book types, printing press components). This involves proficiency in creating diffuse, normal, and other relevant texture maps to bring models to life.

Art Style Adherence: Ensuring all custom assets blend seamlessly with Vintage Story's unique aesthetic.

Visual Communication: Designing elements that are not only visually appealing but also clearly convey their function and interaction within the game.

## Installation & Usage
Installation:
Download the latest release of the Tomes mod from the releases page (or compile from source).

Place the .zip file into your Vintage Story Mods folder.

Launch Vintage Story and ensure the Tomes mod is enabled in the Mod Manager.

## Usage:
Clay Tablets: Craft clay tablets and right-click to open a simple writing interface.

Books: Craft empty books. Right-click to open the book interface, where you can write, add pages, and read.

Gutenberg Printing Press: Gather the necessary materials to craft the various components of the printing press. Assemble the multi-block structure, then insert a master book, ink, and paper to begin printing copies.

## Future Plans
I plan to continue expanding the Tomes mod with features such as:

Bookcases and Libraries: Functional storage solutions for books.

Shared Libraries: Potential for multiplayer integration to share written works.

Advanced Writing Tools: Quill and ink systems, different paper types.
